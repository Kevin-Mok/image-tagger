# Issue 26

Title: Selecting a directory should apply the desired change to all the Images under it

Description: Should work for adding/deleting current tags and adding a tag from the available tags pool.

# Issue 48

Title: Change the current tags display if a directory is selected?

Description: Related to #26, if we want to allow the user to delete a tag from all images inside a subdirectory, maybe we should display all the tags in that directory when it's selected?

# Issue 49

Title: Nested directories now display full path instead of just the last directory

Description: Broken when implementing #26 or #48.

# Issue 50
