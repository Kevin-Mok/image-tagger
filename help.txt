1. You can apply multiple tag actions (i.e. adding/deleting) to multiple images simply by using shift + click to select multiple items in the respective lists.

2. You can apply an action to all the images under a directory (including its sub-directories) by clicking on a directory in the list of images and then performing the action you want as you normally would.

3. You can filter the list of images by selecting an available tag and pressing the "Filter" button.

4. The number in the available tags is how many images you have currently applied that tag to (not only just in current directory).

5. You can upload the currently selected picture to Imgur by pressing the "i" button in the bottom-right corner.
